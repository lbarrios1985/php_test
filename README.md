Best Multi-eSports Player

A videogame company has contracted you to create a program to calculate the Best multi-esport player of each of its tournaments.

Right now, the video games played are League of Legends and Valorant. They plan to add more video games in the future.

You will receive a set of files, each one containing the stats of one game. Each file will start with a row indicating the videogame it refers to.

Each player is assigned a unique nickname

Each file represent a single game

The Best multi-esport player is the player with the most rating points, adding the rating points in all games.

A player will receive 10 additional rating points if their team won the game. Every game must have a winning team. One player may play in different teams and positions in different games, but not in the same game.

The program responsible for generating the files has a bug, that can be reflected in the wrong files format. If one file is wrong, the whole set of files is considered to be wrong and the Best multi-esport player won't be calculated.
